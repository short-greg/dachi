Introduction
------------

**Dachi**: Dachi is a framework for software developers to 

Purpose
-------

To easily more easily train machines without backpropagation using Pytorch.

Key Features
------------

- **Flexibility**: Easily experiment with alternative training methodologies beyond backpropagation.
- **Efficient Customization**: Create your own layers that define how they are optimized.
- **Integrated Tools**: I

Why Dachi?
-----------

- **For Researchers**: If you've ever found PyTorch or TensorFlow too restrictive for your experimental needs, **Zenkai** is for you.
- **Performance**: While prioritizing flexibility, we've ensured that there's minimal overhead. Efficient internal operations make sure that you're not sacrificing speed.
- **Community-Driven**: Built by researchers, for researchers. We value community feedback and contributions.

Architecture
------------

**Dachi** employs a modular, offering both object-oriented architecture and functional programming in its core.
