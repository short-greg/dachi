Brief Introduction
------------------

Dachi  (/dachi/) is a framework for software developers to more easily develop AI applications. It helps with reading the outputs from an LLM and also making decisions.

It is built with a similar API to PyTorch and gives users access to tools for behavior-oriented programming such as Behavior Trees.

Example
-------

Hereâ€™s an example of a Dachi module



This can then be trained by executing the following command

What does it have to offer?
---------------------------

Dachi offers ways to easily interact with AI APIs. It aims to make the interaction resemble programming as close possible.

Dachi also provides means for constructing graphs and workflows and decision processes.

Next Steps
----------

The next step is to install Dachi. The main requirements are to have Pandas and Spacy installed.
