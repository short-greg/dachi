# Post-Communication Phase: Background, OKRs, and Todo List

With the **communication and request handling** section now complete (covering `utils/_store.py`, `utils/_data.py`, `proc/_request.py`, and docstring improvements), the documentation set has reached a milestone: it describes how state, messaging, and async request dispatchers work in detail.

The next logical step is to shift from *infrastructure-level explanations* to *developer-facing guidance*: showing **usage patterns, workflows, and practical tutorials**. This stage is crucial because while the low-level mechanics are now well documented, new contributors and users need **clear guidance on how to combine these components effectively in real-world scenarios**.

## üéØ OKRs

### Objective 1: Provide clear **usage patterns** for core abstractions
- **KR1:** Document at least 3 canonical patterns (e.g., request dispatching, shared state with Blackboard, agent communication with Bulletin).
- **KR2:** Provide runnable code snippets for each pattern.
- **KR3:** Show both minimal and extended examples to balance clarity and depth.

### Objective 2: Develop **workflow-level documentation**
- **KR1:** Write a ‚ÄúHow it fits together‚Äù guide that traces data through state, messaging, and async dispatch.
- **KR2:** Show how a behavior tree or state machine integrates with AsyncDispatcher.
- **KR3:** Document best practices for thread safety and concurrency.

### Objective 3: Build **practical tutorials and examples**
- **KR1:** Publish at least 2 end-to-end tutorials (e.g., chat agent, multi-agent system).
- **KR2:** Demonstrate how to extend the framework with a new dispatcher (e.g., OpenAIDispatcher).
- **KR3:** Create a quick-start workflow (10‚Äì15 lines of code) for newcomers.

## ‚úÖ Todo List (Next Steps)

1. **Usage Patterns**
   - Draft canonical usage docs for:
     - Blackboard (shared state example with scoping).
     - Bulletin (agent/task communication).
     - AsyncDispatcher (job submission, polling, streaming).
   - Include minimal + extended examples.

2. **Workflows**
   - Write an ‚Äúarchitecture in practice‚Äù walkthrough:
     - Show how Msg/Resp + AsyncDispatcher + Blackboard work together.
     - Highlight typical control flow in behavior trees/state machines.
   - Add a concurrency/thread-safety note.

3. **Practical Examples**
   - Create tutorial: simple chat agent (OpenAI dispatcher + Blackboard state).
   - Create tutorial: multi-agent communication (Bulletin passing requests).
   - Add a quick-start ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù with minimal boilerplate.

4. **Documentation Integration**
   - Ensure examples are tested so they stay in sync with codebase.
   - Link tutorials from README.
   - Update README with corrected pillars and references to new tutorials.
