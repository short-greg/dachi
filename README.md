# Dachi - AI Library for Building Intelligent Systems

**Dachi** is designed to provide flexibility and control when building intelligent systems using LLMs (Large Language Models). The library provides developers to interact with large language models and other AI models seamlessly within Python code, to be able to easily process responses from LLMs, and to construct complex behaviors making use of parallelization and other decision processes through the behavior tree paradigm.

## Features

- **Flexible Interaction**: Easily read and interact with LLMs directly in Python code, allowing for more natural and controlled usage.
- **Behavior Trees**: Use behavior trees to build complex behaviors such as decision-making and parallel processes.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define and customize workflows for LLM interaction, giving you fine-grained control over the AI's behavior.

## Installation

To install **Dachi**, use pip:

```bash
pip install dachi
```

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use Dachi to interact with an LLM:

```python
from dachi import LLM

# Instantiate the LLM and read a response
llm = LLM(api_key='your-api-key')
response = llm.query("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

### Advanced usage

You can leverage behavior trees to define more complex interactions and processes with the LLM:

```python
from dachi.act import BehaviorTree, Sequence, Parallel


engine = dachi.adapt.openai.OpenAIChatModel(model='gpt-4o-mini')

# Define behavior tree nodes
@dachi.signaturefunc(engine=engine)
def task1(document: str):
    """
    Extract keywords from the doucment passed in.

    # Document

    {document}
    """
    pass

@dachi.signaturefunc(engine=engine)
def task2(document: str, num_sentences: int):
    """
    Write a summary of the document passed in {num_sentences} sentences

    {document}
    """
    pass


# Create a behavior tree with parallel execution
tree = BehaviorTree(
    root=Parallel([
        dachi.act.taskf(task1, ), 
        dachi.act.taskf(task2)
    ])
)

while status != dachi.act.RUNNING:
    status = tree.tick()
```

## Advanced Usage

### Parallel Processing with Behavior Trees

The behavior tree system allows parallel execution of tasks, enabling more complex behaviors to be modeled:

```python
from dachi.behavior_tree import Parallel

# Define tasks for parallel execution
parallel_tasks = Parallel([
    lambda: llm.query("First task"),
    lambda: llm.query("Second task")
])

# Execute tasks
parallel_tasks.execute()
```

### Custom Decision-Making Logic

Build decision-making logic based on specific criteria:

```python
from dachi.behavior_tree import Sequence, Condition

def is_high_priority():
    # Custom condition check
    return True

def high_priority_task():
    return llm.query("High priority task query")

# Create a sequence with a condition
decision_tree = Sequence([
    Condition(is_high_priority),
    high_priority_task
])

decision_tree.execute()
```

## Roadmap

- **Model Integration**: Support for more advanced LLMs and additional integrations.
- **Improved Performance**: Optimizations for faster execution and scalability.
- **Enhanced Customization**: Additional hooks for developer-defined behavior.
